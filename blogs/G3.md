# Low Fidelity Prototype

## Description
Our app is a discord bot called Translator.io. Initially, we are focusing on
translating text chat in different languages between users. This is what our
prototype is simulating. Later on in the quarter, we will look into translating
voice chat as well. 

To add the bot to a server, the owner of the bot will generate a link, which is
then sent to an administrator of the server that the bot will be added to. After
the bot is added, its commands and functions will be available for that server.

In terms of components, once Translator.io is added to the server, the server
members will be interacting with the bot by typing ‘/’ and then multiple options
will pop up. These represent the different possible commands the bot will accept
right now. For the prototype we have a single backslash command, “/hola”. This
command when run will send back “hello” which is a translation of spanish to
english. Later on we plan to develop the user interface where a message can be
put in the server and Translator.io will respond back with the translated message.

For now, we are faking the language translation. Right now, we have a single
command which is /hola, and it always returns “hello”. We will later implement
a general ‘translate’ command that takes in the message we want translated as
a parameter. We are thinking of using the Google Translate API for text translation. 
The following is an image of the commands for the discord bot and output after
running a command:

## Findings from the wizard of oz testing
For our wizard of oz session, our main goal was to see what the users’ thoughts
on how Translator.io would be used as well as whether there were any parts that
they didn’t like at the moment. After completing the wizard of oz session and
getting feedback, we learned that a general translator command would be something
that users would like to have where users can put in the command and the message
will be translated or the message translates automatically. Furthermore, we asked
about whether a direct message would be a better alternative, but users said that
our current approach is an easier way to use it for them. After asking for some
possible improvements, one of the users in the wizard of oz testing suggested we
implement a way for the bot to be restricted to only certain discord channels since
users didn’t want every channel to have messages translated. 


After completing the session, we found the findings promising enough to continue 
the project since overall the testers in the wizard of oz session felt like it
was a good idea but there are many changes that would have to be made. In the next
iteration, we will remove the hola command since it doesn’t do anything and instead
have a more general command. Furthermore, we will change the structure of the message
that is sent to the users and make it more informative. For example, putting the
language that is being translated from and adding the original message and the translation.
Also, adding the ability to restrict the bot to certain channels which will give more power
to the users. In terms of things that will stay the same, we plan to use a command that will
be used to translate a message like what was done in the wizard of oz testing session.
